# TikTok Engagement Prediction

This project aims to predict the like count of TikTok videos based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `tiktok_dataset.csv` from [Kaggle](link to the dataset).  It contains information about TikTok videos, including their duration, transcription, and engagement metrics.

## Project Structure

* `data/`: Contains the raw dataset.
* `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook with the analysis and modeling code.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/spitzer4/tiktok-engagement-prediction.git`
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended): `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook notebooks/prediction.ipynb`

## Methodology

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
* Model evaluation

## Results

# TODO
